### 1. Introduction

$~$

This document was inspired by noticing the convergence of artifical intelligence with ecological research and the ground breaking developement of the <a href="https://birdnet.cornell.edu/"> BirdNET</a> algorithm developed by Dr. Stefan Kahl with the K. Lisa Yang Center for Conservation Bioacoustics at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. 

$~$

Birdnet is an machine learning model developed using tensorflow, which is a software library developed by Google to be used to develop deal learning ai algorithms that can make predictions based on a large dataset of pre-trained data. Birdnet is trained based on hundreds of thousands of bird calls from Cornell Lab of Ornithology across various species, and can provide predictions for around 3,000 bird calls worldwide. To simply put it, if you have an audio file with various bird calls, BirdNET can be used to identify which species are calling in the given audio-file at which time of the audio and to what degree it believes that species to be. If you think you want to have this software available, this document is going to show you the steps I have developed to streamline a weeks worth of audio files to be processed to see which species occur in a given area.

$~$

Now, before I explain my process, I want to highlight some alternatives that can be done with BirdNET. BirdNET was developed in Python, therefore, if you have a real foundation in the Python language, I encourage you to explore Dr. Kalh's <a href="https://github.com/kahst/BirdNET-Analyzer"> github repository</a>. In the github repo, Dr, Kahl explains how one would set up the python environment and run the model through either Ubuntu or Windows. There is an option to use a GUI he developed to run a single audio file to analyze, but if you want to run multiple files with one command, I encourage you to explore my option. Finally, within Dr. Kahl's github repository he provides other projects that have used BirdNET to identify birds in real time from ARU units. 

$~$

If you have decided to listen to my alternative framework on how I have been using birdnet for both species investigation and potential incorporation on ESA surveys, below I will run a step-by-step process from recording the data from the field to processing the audios on my Windows Laptop.

$~$

The only pre-requisites required for my framework is a general understanding of the R language, which for most young biologists that have went through Graduate School should have a fundamental understanding. If you are one who is not familiar with R & Rstudio, I suggest you watch [[**this quick video.**]{.ul}](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVKMsaWju8w&amp;t=52s)ðŸ¤©

### 2. The Framework

$~$

1. Deploy Automatic Recording Units (ARUs) into the field of study.

2. Download the audio recordings to the computer, and convert the wav and/or mp3 files to SITEID_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS format. 

3. Set-up BirdNET with the <a href="https://github.com/nationalparkservice/NSNSDAcoustics"> NSNSDAcoustics package</a> developed by Cathleen Balantic with the National Parks Service.

4. Run your modified version of the "bird_scanner.R" R script from the <a href="https://github.com/jkauphus/Bird_Scanner"> Bird-Scanner Repository</a>.

5. Check predictions using the "bird-checker.R" script
