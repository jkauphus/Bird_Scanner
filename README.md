These scripts and gui are to develop an R ecosystem and eventual application to run the Bird-Net Algorithm in R

These scripts are modified on the NSNSDAcoutics R package that leverages the Bird-Net tensorflow model to extract avian calls through wav files in a very streamline and intuative manor.

Main scripts will batch run the bird-net model to analyze multiple wav files and output a table with the predicts species within each wave file analyzed.
