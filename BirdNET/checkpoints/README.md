## BirdNET Analyzer Model Version History

This repository contains only the latest version of the BirdNET-Analyzer model. We will track the changes in this document and also provide permanent download links to previous versions for testing and/or other use cases. 

You can download and unzip previous model versions, make sure to update the `MODEL_PATH` and `LABELS_FILE` variable in the `config.py` file to the version you want to use.

Model update history:

**V2.4**
- more than 6,000 species worldwide
- covers frequencies from 0 Hz to 15 kHz with two-channel spectrogram (one for low and one for high frequencies)
- 0.826 GFLOPs, 50.5 MB as FP32
- enhanced and optimized metadata model
- global selection of species (birds and non-birds) with 6,522 classes (incl. 10 non-event classes)

**V2.3**

- slightly larger (36.4 MB vs. 21.3 MB as FP32) but smaller computational footprint (0.698 vs. 1.31 GFLOPs) than V2.2
- larger embedding size (1024 vs 320) than V2.2 (hence the bigger model)
- enhanced and optimized metadata model
- global selection of species (birds and non-birds) with 3,337 classes (incl. 10 non-event classes)

**V2.2**

- smaller (21.3 MB vs. 29.5 MB as FP32) and faster (1.31 vs 2.03 GFLOPs) than V2.1
- maintains same accuracy as V2.1 despite more classes
- global selection of species (birds and non-birds) with 3,337 classes (incl. 10 non-event classes)
